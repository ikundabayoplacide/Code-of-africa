# Code-of-africa challenges.

# Introduction to Gallery challenge.

This project demonstrates a modal image viewer with thumbnail navigation. Users can click on images displayed in a grid to view them in full size within a modal. The modal also includes thumbnail images at the bottom for easy navigation between images.

# how to Runn Project, the following are steps to follow:

> Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
> Open the index.html file in a web browser.

# How to use this app.

.Upon opening the webpage, you'll see a grid of images with captions.
.Click on any image or the "Know more" button to open the modal.
.In the modal, you can view the full-size image along with its caption.
.Thumbnails are displayed at the bottom of the modal for easy navigation.
.Click on a thumbnail to switch to a different image.

# File structure

1."index.html": Contains the HTML structure of the webpage.
2."css/style.css": Defines the styles for the webpage layout and modal.
3."javascript/script.js": Implements the functionality for opening the modal, displaying full-size images, and handling thumbnail navigation

# README FOR ARRAYMAP CHALLENGE.

# introduction for arrayMap challenge.

 for the arrayMap function:
 The arrayMap function is designed to check whether any contiguous subarray of the given array has a sum equal to the specified target value

 about this "function arrayMap(arr, target)" it contains :
 1. "arr": An array of integers.
 2. "target": The target sum value to be checked against the subarrays of arr.

 # FUNCTIONALITY

 The function iterates through the array arr using two pointers, left and right, to define a window representing the current subarray being evaluated. It maintains a currentSum variable to keep track of the sum of elements within this window.

 how will happen for each iteration:

 1. It adds the element at the right pointer to currentSum.
 2. Checks if currentSum exceeds target. If so, it moves the left pointer to the right and subtracts elements from currentSum until currentSum is less than or equal to target.
3. If currentSum equals target, it returns true, indicating that a subarray with the target sum has been found.
4. If the loop completes without finding a subarray with the target sum, the function returns false.

# how to run this:

1. Copy the provided arrayMap function into your JavaScript code or file.
2. Invoke the arrayMap function with an array (arr) and a target value (target) as arguments.
3. "Check the Output": Run your JavaScript code (in a browser console or using Node.js) and observe the output
4. "Modify Inputs": You can modify the arr and target values to test different scenarios and observe the function's behavior

# README FOR STRINGTRANSFORMATION 

# introduction:
The stringTransform function manipulates a given input string based on its length.

# how it will work:
the following is operation that should be performed:

* for the input string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., by 15): it will perform the following
.Reverse the string.
.Replace each character with its ASCII code, separated by spaces

* If the length of the input string is divisible by 3: it will Reverse the string.
* If the length of the input string is divisible by 5: it will Replace each character with its ASCII code, separated by spaces.

# how to run this string transformation

steps:

- Copy the provided stringTransform function into your JavaScript code or file.
- Invoke the stringTransform function with a string input as an argument.let us use example 
{
const input = "Placide";
const transformed = stringTransform(input);
console.log(transformed); // Output: "87 111 114 108 100 32 111 108 108 101 72"
}

- Check the Output: Run your JavaScript code (in a browser console or using Node.js) and observe the output. In this example, the output will be the transformed string based on the rules defined in the function

- Modify Inputs: You can modify the input string to test different scenarios and observe the function's behavior.

Thanks.
